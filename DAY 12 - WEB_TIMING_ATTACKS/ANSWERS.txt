# 🎄 Advent of Cyber — Day 11: Race Conditions and Exploits

## 🔍 Objective
Demonstrate a race condition exploit to transfer funds and extract hidden data — specifically, triggering a logic flaw by submitting multiple requests in rapid succession.

---

## 🧪 Tools Used
- 🛠️ Burp Suite Community Edition (local VM setup)
- 🦊 Firefox with manual proxy routing
- 💻 TryHackMe target machine
- 🔁 Repeater tab in Burp Suite to simulate race condition

---

## 🎯 Flag Discovered

### ✅ After transferring more than $2000 from Glitch’s account:
THM{WON_THE_RACE_007}


---

## 📝 Important Note

> ⚠️ **Don't forget to send more than `$2000` from Glitch’s account to trigger the flag.**  
This action exploits a race condition and unlocks hidden server logic.

## 📁 Workflow Summary
- Used Firefox routed through Burp
- Intercepted fund transfer POST request
- Crafted and replayed multiple rapid transactions using Repeater
- Triggered the logic flaw by exceeding $2000 threshold
- Captured the flag embedded in the server response

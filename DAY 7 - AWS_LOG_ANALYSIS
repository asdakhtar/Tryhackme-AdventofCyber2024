# 🚨 Day 7: AWS Suspicious Activity Investigation

## 🧠 Challenge Overview
Analyzing AWS CloudTrail logs to identify suspicious actions by a rogue user (`glitch`) and uncover indicators of compromise.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| Other activity made by `glitch` aside from `ListObject` | `PutObject` |
| Source IP related to S3 bucket activities | `53.94.201.69` |
| AWS service generating `ConsoleLogin` events | `signin.amazonaws.com` |
| Timestamp of `ConsoleLogin` by anomalous user | `2024-11-28T15:21:54Z` |
| Name of user created by `mcskidy` | `glitch` |
| Type of access assigned to anomalous user | `AdministratorAccess` |
| Mayor Malware’s typical login IP | `53.94.201.69` |
| McSkidy’s actual IP address | `31.210.15.79` |
| Mayor Malware's bank account number | `2394 6912 7723 1294` |

## 🧪 Analysis Notes

- `glitch` was granted high-level permissions (`AdministratorAccess`) and performed unauthorized S3 operations (`PutObject`).
- Activity originated from IP `53.94.201.69`, tied to Mayor Malware’s typical login behavior.
- Creation of `glitch` user from `mcskidy`’s account suggests insider threat or credential compromise.
- Event logged via `signin.amazonaws.com`, helping isolate the service involved.
- Use of CloudTrail logs allowed precise timestamping and attribution of anomalous access.

## 🛡️ Takeaway

This challenge reinforces the importance of:
- Regular IAM reviews and permission audits
- Monitoring CloudTrail logs for behavioral anomalies
- Flagging unusual resource activity patterns tied to specific IPs or users

# 🔐 Advent of Cyber 2024 — Day 16 Walkthrough: Azure Key Vault Secrets

**Challenge Theme:** Cloud Security  
**Target Focus:** Azure Vault Secret Enumeration and Recovery

---

## 🧭 Overview

In this challenge, we explored Azure Key Vault misconfigurations that exposed sensitive secrets. The scenario involved a fictional company named *BackupWare* that had accidentally leaked credentials within its Azure environment.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Enumeration Steps

### 🔹 Step 1: Accessing the Azure Vault  
Using the provided credentials or endpoint, we began enumerating the Azure Vault service via CLI or browser interface. Key points:

- **Vault URL** was accessible due to loose permissions.
- No IP restrictions or role-based access controls were enforced.

### 🔹 Step 2: Identifying Secret Groups  
We discovered a secret group named:

```txt
Group ID: 7d96660a-02e1-4112-9515-1762d0cb66b7
```

This group held a sensitive recovery secret linked to the BackupWare infrastructure.

### 🔹 Step 3: Listing Vault Secrets  
Using CLI or the Azure portal, we listed available secrets and found:

```txt
Secret Name: aoc2024
```

### 🔹 Step 4: Revealing the Secret  
Retrieving the value revealed highly sensitive content:

```txt
Secret Value: WhereIsMyMind1999
```

This was likely a production recovery key or backup credential.

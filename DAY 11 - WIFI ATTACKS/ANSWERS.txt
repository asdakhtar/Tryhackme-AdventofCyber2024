| Question                                                         | Answer                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| What is the BSSID of our wireless interface?                    | `02:00:00:00:02:00`             |
| What is the SSID and BSSID of the access point?                 | `MalwareM_AP`, `02:00:00:00:00:00` |
| What is the BSSID of the wireless interface connected to the AP?| `02:00:00:00:01:00`             |
| What is the PSK after performing the WPA cracking attack?       | `fluffy/champ24`                |

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
- `aircrack-ng` for WPA cracking (dictionary attack)
- `iwconfig` & `ifconfig` to inspect wireless interfaces
- Packet capture inspection to identify SSIDs and BSSIDs
- Ubuntu terminal for all commands to reinforce CLI skills

---

## 📘 Notes
- Confirmed SSID visibility through beacon frames.
- BSSID identification relied on MAC address matching across captured frames.
- Cracking PSK required wordlist tuning and correct handshake capture.

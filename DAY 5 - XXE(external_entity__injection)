## 💡 Why I Ran This on My Ubuntu VM Instead of the AttackBox

TryHackMe’s AttackBox browser failed to send POST requests reliably during form-based interactions, possibly due to resource or network constraints.

Additionally:
- Burp Suite's embedded browser didn’t render pages or intercept properly within AttackBox.
- My local Ubuntu VM offers persistent tooling, faster response time, and full control over traffic, storage, and configuration.
- Using OpenVPN, I securely connected to the TryHackMe lab environment and routed Firefox through Burp to analyze traffic without limitation.

This approach gave me precision, stability, and a flexible debugging workflow.

## 📁 Notes
- All intercepted traffic was captured via Burp and verified using `Repeater` and `Proxy` tabs.
- Proxy configuration was manually set in Firefox with Burp listener active on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
- Additional cleanup scripts were used to free disk space for Burp’s launch and temp storage.

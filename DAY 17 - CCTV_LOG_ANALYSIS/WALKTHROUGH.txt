## 🎥 Day 17 – Watching You: CCTV Footage Tampering

### 🕵️ Scenario Recap
A suspicious deletion of CCTV footage triggered an investigation. Our job: trace the attacker’s movements across web logs, session data, and camera feeds, uncover their identity, and understand how they bypassed security measures.

### 📁 Logs Analyzed
- `web_logs`
- `cctv_logs`
- `cctv_feed`
- `session_id`
- `ips`

### 🔍 Timeline of Events
1. **Brute Force Attempts**  
   Numerous failed login attempts spotted in the `web_logs` — classic brute-force behavior against multiple accounts.

2. **Successful Login Detected**  
   Among the chaos, one session successfully authenticated. From `cctv_feed`, we matched **642 logs** tied to this login session — strong indicator of post-login activity.

3. **Camera Stream Access**  
   The attacker watched several CCTV feeds. Live stream playback events and clip downloads were recorded in `cctv_feed`.

4. **Stream Downloads Initiated**  
   We found evidence of multiple streams being downloaded — sign of possible offline footage tampering or exfiltration.

5. **Footage Deletion**  
   `cctv_logs` revealed deletion events. Linking timestamps, we correlated these actions to the attacker’s session ID and IP.

6. **IP & Session Correlation**  
   The attacker’s IP was linked to **three session IDs**. We traced these sessions back to `cctv_feed` and `web_logs`.

### 🔗 Key Artifacts
| Data Point                      | Value                                |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Session ID (Attacker)**      | `rij5uu4gt204q0d3eb7jj86okt`         |
| **Name (from cctv_feed logs)** | `mmalware`                           |
| **Successful Login Logs**      | `642 entries in cctv_feed`           |

### 🧠 Analyst Takeaways
- **Log correlation** across feed types is essential — don't overlook session IDs and matching timestamps.
- **IP reuse** often reveals hidden session activity. Chaining across users can expose attacker pivots.
- **Footage deletion actions** often mimic normal admin behavior, so pattern matching post-authentication events is key.

## 🎄 Advent of Cyber – Day 23: Hash Cracking & Hidden Flags

### 🧩 Challenge Summary  
We were provided with a file named `hash1.txt` containing a hashed value. The task was to crack the hash and identify the original password. Once cracked, we were to explore a `private.pdf` file and retrieve the hidden flag.

### 🔍 Step 1: Crack the Hash  
The hash stored in `hash1.txt` was:

```
$6$rounds=5000$...
```

This format indicates a **SHA-512 crypt hash**, commonly used in Linux shadow files.

#### ✅ Cracked Password:
```
fluffycat12
```

Tool used: `hashcat` or `john` with appropriate wordlists and hash mode.

### 📂 Step 2: Extract the Flag from private.pdf  
After cracking the password, we accessed `private.pdf`. The flag was embedded at the top of the document.

#### 🏁 Flag:
```
THM{do_not_GET_CAUGHT}
```

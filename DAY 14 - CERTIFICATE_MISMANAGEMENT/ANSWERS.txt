## Lab Setup

- Attacker VM: TryHackMe AttackBox  
- Target URL: https://gift-scheduler.thm  

---

## Tasks & Answers

1. Capture and inspect the TLS certificate  
   
   - Certificate Authority: THM  

2. Retrieve elf credentials from Burp HTTP history  
   
   - Username: snowballelf  
   - Password: c4rrotn0s3  

3. Log in as an elf and capture the flag  
   
   - Flag: THM{AoC-3lf0nth3Sh3lf}  

4. Harvest the mayor’s account credentials  
   
   - Username: marta_mayware  
   - Password: H0llyJ0llySOCMAS!  

5. Access the admin console and retrieve the final flag  
   
   - Flag: THM{AoC-h0wt0ru1nG1ftD4y}

## Observations

- Burp Suite’s HTTP history reveals hidden POST parameters and credentials.  
- Inspecting the TLS certificate confirms you’re interacting with the genuine Gift Scheduler service.  
- Certificate mismanagement allowed a predictable CA name and facilitated easy spoofing.  
- Credential reuse and lack of strong certificate validation lead to full system compromise.
